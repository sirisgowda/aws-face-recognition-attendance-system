# AWS Face Recognition Attendance System

## Overview

The **AWS Face Recognition Attendance System** is a cloud-based attendance management application that automates employee attendance using facial recognition. The system integrates multiple AWS services to provide secure identity verification, attendance tracking, geo-fencing validation, emotion detection, and real-time alert notifications.

The application captures images through a webcam, verifies identities using Amazon Rekognition, stores employee and attendance data in Amazon DynamoDB, saves images in Amazon S3, and sends email alerts through Amazon SNS for unauthorized access attempts.
